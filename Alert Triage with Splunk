Task 2 — Initial Alert Triage
• Which alert did you investigate first (highest severity)? → Unusual Base64 Encoded PowerShell
• User associated with this alert: → svc_webapp
• Source IP seen in the alert: → 10.10.142.11
• Destination domain contacted: → malicious-data.exfil.net

Task 3 — Threshold Rules & Splunk Queries
• Which Splunk search detected brute force activity?

index=wineventlog sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4625 | stats count by src_ip


• What threshold rule triggered the alert?
→ More than 5 failed login attempts within 10 minutes
• Flag gained after this alert: → THM{split_the_failures}

Task 4 — Pivoting on User Activity
• Next suspicious alert type: → Suspicious Scheduled Task Creation
• User executing the scheduled task: → svc_backup
• Task name seen in event logs: → AutoUpdateJob
• Flag gained after investigating scheduled task: → THM{scheduled_but_not_safe}

Task 5 — Detecting Pivoting Activity
• Which evidence showed lateral movement?
→ Remote execution of psexec.exe from host A to host B
• Command line used in the lateral activity:

psexec.exe \\10.10.142.12 -u administrator -p P@ssw0rd cmd.exe


• Flag gained after this task: → THM{moving_through_the_network}

Task 6 — Final Correlation
• Splunk query showing both brute force + task creation:

index=wineventlog (EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4698) | stats count by src_ip, user


• Final flag for completing alert triage with correlation:
→ THM{splunk_alert_mastery}
