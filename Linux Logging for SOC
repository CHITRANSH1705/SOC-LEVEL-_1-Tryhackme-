Task 2 — SSH and Authentication Logs
• Which event indicates a failed SSH authentication? → sshd: Failed password
• Username used in the failed SSH attempt: → sysadmin
• IP address that performed the failed login: → 10.10.20.105
• Which SSH event indicates a successful login? → Accepted password

Task 3 — Sudo and Privilege Use
• User who used sudo to list root processes: → analyst
• Which command did they run with sudo? → ps aux | grep root
• Flag found in sudo logs: → THM{sudo_alert_detected}

Task 4 — System Logs — Daemon Activity
• Service that restarted unexpectedly: → cron
• Time of the unexpected restart (syslog timestamp): → 2025-09-18 03:21:15
• Reason for restart (based on log message): → segfault (core dumped)

Task 5 — Kernel and Audit Logs
• Which kernel log entry shows process termination by OOM killer? → Killed process 1826 (malware)
• PID of the terminated process: → 1826
• Rule that triggered the audit log entry: → audit: execve
• Flag in audit logs: → THM{audit_exec_detected}

Task 6 — Log Correlation
• SIEM search that correlated SSH and sudo activity:

index=syslog OR index=audit | stats count by host, user


• What anomaly did the correlation reveal? → Failed SSH attempts from 10.10.20.105 followed by analyst using sudo soon after
• Final flag for completing the room: → THM{linux_log_master}
