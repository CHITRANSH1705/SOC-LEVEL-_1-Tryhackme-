Task 2 — Baseline Activity
• Which system process generated the first suspicious log entry? → cron
• What type of activity did cron trigger? → unexpected script execution
• Script name associated with the anomaly: → daily_backup.sh

Task 3 — Process Monitoring
• Which process was spawned with root privileges unexpectedly? → malware_runner
• Parent process of the suspicious execution: → sshd
• User who initiated this activity: → guest
• Timestamp of the execution (syslog): → 2025-09-20 07:13:09

Task 4 — Logging & Authentication
• Type of SSH authentication failure seen in logs: → invalid user
• Username used in the invalid login attempt: → testuser
• IP address tied to this failed login event: → 10.10.30.22

Task 5 — System Audit Logs
• Which audit rule reported the abnormal execution? → audit: execve
• What was the audit result code for the event: → failure (EACCES)
• Flag found in the audit output: → THM{audit_shows_truth}

Task 6 — Log Correlation
• Log search that correlated process execution + failed SSH attempts:

index=syslog OR index=audit | stats count by exe, user, src_ip


• What suspicious pattern did the correlation reveal? → guest logged in via SSH from 10.10.30.22 and immediately spawned malware_runner
• Final flag for completing the room: → THM{linux_threat_detected}
