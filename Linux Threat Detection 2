Task 2 — Interactive Log Review
• Which user account failed to authenticate multiple times? → svcweb
• IP address associated with repeated login failures: → 10.10.74.19
• Name of the service that logged the failures: → sshd

Task 3 — Process Creation Monitoring
• Executable spawned suspiciously with a random name: → updsvc
• Parent process name for the suspicious exe: → bash
• User that executed the suspicious process: → analyst
• What was the timestamp of the suspicious process creation? → 2025-10-08 14:22:09

Task 4 — Network Connection Inspection
• Which port saw a high number of outbound connections? → 4444
• What was the most common destination IP in these connections: → 203.0.113.225
• Protocol for the outbound connections: → TCP

Task 5 — Audit and Kernel Logs
• Which audit rule matched the suspicious execution: → audit: execve
• Which kernel log showed a segmentation violation: → kernel: segfault at …
• Flag found within the audit trace output: → THM{audit_exposes_hidden}

Task 6 — Log Correlation and Final Flag
• Query that correlated audit + SSH logs:

index=syslog OR index=audit | stats count by exe, user, src_ip


• Anomalous pattern identified:
→ svcweb failing SSH then updsvc spawned by analyst soon after
• Final room flag: → THM{linux_threat_detected_pro}
