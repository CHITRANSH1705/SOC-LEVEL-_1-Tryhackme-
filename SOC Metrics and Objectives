Task 1 — Introduction
• No answer needed (intro only)

Task 2 — Core Metrics
• Is zero alerts for one month a good sign for your SOC team? → Nay
• What is the False Positive Rate if only 10 out of 50 alerts appear to be real threats? → 80%

Task 3 — Triage Metrics
• If the SOC team receives a critical alert on Saturday, and the team works 8/5, on which day will they acknowledge the alert? → Monday
• Provide MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR (in minutes) for the malware scenario → 12,10,51

Task 4 — Improving Metrics
• What is the False Positive Rate limit you should aim not to reach? → 80%
• Should all SOC roles work together to keep metrics improving? (Yea/Nay) → Yea

Task 5 — Practice Scenarios
• Flag after first scenario: THM{mttr:quick_start_but_slow_response}
• Flag after second scenario: THM{mttd:time_between_attack_and_alert}
• Flag after third scenario: THM{fpr:the_main_cause_of_l1_burnout}

Task 6 — Conclusion
• No answers required
